    <h3>Isolated step scope</h3>

    <p>
        This step has an isolated step scope, which means we cannot manipulate our data directly. Instead, we need to grab our data
        when a step is instantiated (i.e. when our step controller is instantiated), and we need to save our changes when we navigate
        away.
    </p>

    <p>
        In an isolated step controller, we can inject <strong>multiStepFormScope</strong> which is our directive's scope. And we can
        use the $destroy event to save any data which has been modified by the user.
