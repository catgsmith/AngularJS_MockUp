    <h3>Steps are like modals...</h3>

    <p>
        If you have played with the previous example (<a href="#/using-forms">Using forms</a>), you have noticed that if you entered an email and a name and then press next followed by previous, your data is no longer there.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is because a step is like a view: it is instantiated when called. In other words, if you press "Next" and then "Previous", you are back where you were except that
        the step you are viewing has been freshly instantiated. And any data living in a step's scope will disappear.
